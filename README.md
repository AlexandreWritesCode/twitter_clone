## Description
A simple Ruby on Rails clone of Twitter.

## Lessons Learned
 - Additional Ruby experience
 - Learned Rails 4 concepts
 - User authentication
 - Application of REST model and MVC
 - Introduction to a web framework

## Instructions
### Step 1: Install gems
  	In the terminal, type
     		% bundle
  
  The following gems were used:
  
 - bootstrap
 - bcrypt
 - faker
 - paginate
 
### Step 2: Raking and running
	First, create the database
		% rake db:migrate
	Then run the server
		% rails s

### Step 3: Viewing my website
    In a browser, go to
        % localhost:3000

### Note
	If the gem, 'postgres' doesn't work (as it initially gave me problems in my development), I found using 
		% sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
	and then going through the above steps again circumvented the problem.

## User Guide

 - Start off by creating an account. All you have to do is provide your name, email, and password (no account validation so you can get started right off the bat!)
 - Customize your avatar (using Gravatar)
 - Start following people to populate your feed
 - Make posts: these will appear on your feed and profile view
